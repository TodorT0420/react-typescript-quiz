# Quiz App

## Description

This is a small quiz application that allows you to select the number of questions, the category, and the difficulty of the questions. The application is developed with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **TypeScript**. For styling, the **Chakra UI** library is used. The data for the questions are fetched from the **Trivia API** using the **axios** library. The **Lottie** library is used for animations.

## Features

- **Home Page**: There is a slider through which we can select how many questions we want to answer.
- **Category Selection**: There is a button that takes us to a view where we can select the category of the questions.
- **Difficulty Selection**: There is a button that takes us to a page where we can select the difficulty of the questions.
- **Quiz Start**: After selecting the difficulty, we can start the quiz with a button. We have 10 seconds to answer each question. When we select a given answer, all answers are colored in red for the wrong ones and green for the correct ones.
- **Animations**: There is also an animation that shows us whether we have given the correct answer.
- **Progress Bar**: Above the question itself, we have a progress bar that shows us how many questions we have answered so far and whether they are correct or wrong.
- **Score View**: In the end, we have a score view where the user sees their result.
